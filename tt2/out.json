    "text": "Arizona-based OB/GYN Dr. Greg Marchand said his expert opinion was stripped from a Parents Magazine article 48 hours after publication because it failed to tow the liberal line on abortion.\n\n\"The focus of this article was some TikTok craze where people were being told that their lives would be in danger if they needed an abortion in an emergency circumstance. As a result of that, they were being encouraged to make a living will to let doctors know that they wanted their lives saved before the lives of their baby,\" he told Fox News Digital Tuesday.\n\nThe article published on March 7 focused particularly on these decisions, should complications arise during delivery, including one TikTok video from user Mackenzie Lopez whose overlaid caption informed doctors to save her instead of her baby if complications arose during birth.\n\nOKLAHOMA SUPREME COURT GREENLIGHTS LIFE-OF-MOTHER EXCEPTION TO ABORTION LAW\n\nMarchand's contributions went against popular pro-abortion narratives that pro-life laws would harm mothers, by scaring doctors with legal repercussions for performing abortions in the event of complications.\n\nOne redacted quote read: \"All board-certified OB-GYNs in the United States understand when a [birthing parent's] life is in danger, none of us are afraid to act… I would never hesitate to terminate a pregnancy when a [parent's] life is in danger, and I am certain I speak for every board-certified OB-GYN in the country when I say that. None of us are scared; none of us want to 'check with our lawyers' or need a refresher on the law.\"\n\nOther redacted quotes suggested that \"life-of-mother\" situations exist, but not on the \"emergency basis\" suggested.\n\nWYOMING OUTLAWS ABORTION PILLS, BECOMING FIRST STATE TO ENACT BAN\n\n\"There is no situation where the immediate decision to save the mother or baby must be made,\" one quote read.\n\nParents Magazine later quoted Marchand as saying, \"Plainly put, there are no situations where a doctor must make a 'save one or the other decision' urgently… If something has gotten to the point where an emergency surgery must be performed, there is no longer a choice at that moment.\"\n\nThese comments along with others were removed without explanation nearly two days after the article was published. Marchand added that he was unaware of the change until after he posted the article to social media and became inundated with messages notifying him that his comments had been removed.\n\nWISCONSIN GOV. EVERS MOVES AGAINST STATE ABORTION BAN AHEAD OF SUPREME COURT ELECTION\n\n\"What's really remarkable is these weren't really pro-life opinions per se,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't like I was on there saying all abortions are wrong or all abortion is murder or something like that,\" he said. \"What I was doing was presenting the factual arguments, the facts of the case, so to speak, as to why the disinformation from the left just wasn't true and why there are no emergency circumstances where doctors are going to have to choose between your life and the baby's life, and there's just no circumstances where elective abortion laws are going to make a woman's life be in danger from other types of emergency situations.\"\n\nMarchand said he suspects the magazine edited out his comments because they did not suit their \"pro-choice views.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The disinformation that goes around abortion is really some of the most powerful disinformation there is,\" he said.\n\n\"Most of the other disinformation that comes from the left, for example, if somebody wants to say so-and-so is a racist or so-and-so wants to pass a law to ban homosexuality or ban interracial marriage, that's easy to disprove,\" he added. \"The average person can just make a few clicks and go ahead and see that that's false, but, in these cases, there's a little bit more medicine to it, there's a little medical terminology, and somebody who's not very familiar with medical terminology or medicine really could fall into the trap of believing this.\"\n\nMarchand said he reached out to the Parents Magazine via Twitter and also contacted the article's author to ask about the quote removal and received no response from either.\n\nParents Magazine didn't respond to a request for comment.",

A preliminary injunction dissolved in January when a federal judge ruled the law did not violate Title IX protections but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to reinstate a preliminary injunction.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nArensman was one of 67 athletes, coaches and family members who called on the Supreme Court to vacate the preliminary injunction. In the brief, Arensman said she had retired from the sport and cited an incident at the USA Cycling Cyclocross National Championships in December.\n\n\"I was born into a family of athletes. Encouraged by my parents and siblings, I competed in sports from a young age, and I followed in my sister’s footsteps, climbing the ranks to become an elite cyclocross racer,\" her message read. \"Over the past few years, I have had to race directly with male cyclists in women’s events. As this has become more of a reality, it has become increasingly discouraging to train as hard as I do only to have to lose to a man with the unfair advantage of an androgenized body that intrinsically gives him an obvious advantage over me, no matter how hard I train.\n\nSUPREME COURT COULD TAKE FIRST TRANSGENDER SPORTS CASE WITH APPEAL FROM WEST VIRGINIA SOCCER PLAYER\n\n\"I have decided to end my cycling career. At my last race at the recent UCI Cyclocross National Championships in the elite women’s category in December 2022, I came in 4th place, flanked on either side by male riders awarded 3rd and 5th places. My sister and family sobbed as they watched a man finish in front of me, having witnessed several physical interactions with him throughout the race.\n\n\"Additionally, it is difficult for me to think about the very real possibility I was overlooked for an international selection on the US team at Cyclocross Worlds in February 2023 because of a male competitor.\n\n\"Moving forward, I feel for young girls learning to compete and who are growing up in a day when they no longer have a fair chance at being the new record holders and champions in cycling because men want to compete in our division. I have felt deeply angered, disappointed, overlooked, and humiliated that the rule makers of women’s sports do not feel it is necessary to protect women’s sports to ensure fair competition for women anymore.\"\n\nAustin Killips finished in third place in the race and Jenna Lingwood finished in fifth place. Both athletes are transgender women competing against biological women in the events.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nArensman had finished in the top five in her final seven races. According to Cross Results, she has 35 wins in her career.",

    "text": "Evan Corcoran, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, was spotted Thursday entering the D.C. federal courthouse amid several ongoing special counsel investigations.\n\nThe hearing likely relates to special counsel Jack Smith’s subpoena to former Vice President Mike Pence amid ongoing inquiries into alleged efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhile only in attendance for a private hearing Thursday, Corcoran is expected to testify later this week before the the special counsel grand jury that's looking into Trump's handling of the classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate last year, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nSeparate from the Jan. 6 probe, a federal judge ruled that Corcoran could provide additional testimony in the probe looking into the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and whether the former president intentionally misled his lawyers about the situation.\n\nSmith's team filed enough evidence to support allegations Trump may have committed a crime through his attorneys, according to the order.\n\nTHE LEAKS IN DOJ'S CASE AGAINST TRUMP 'MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE SYSTEM': LEGAL EXPERT\n\nThe ruling from U.S. Judge Beryl Howell, which applied the \"crime fraud\" exception, allowed prosecutors to bypass protections offered to Corcoran through attorney-client privilege.\n\nHowell — whose role as chief judge expired over the weekend when the rotating position was given to Judge James Boasberg — sided with federal investigators and issued an order last week moving Corcoran to testify in detail about conversations he had with Trump over documents later seized by the FBI at his Mar-A-Lago Florida estate last summer.\n\nFollowing Howell's initial order, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay on Tuesday and both the special counsel and the Trump legal team were asked for responses regarding Corcoran's testimony. Trump’s legal team submitted filings as required before midnight and DOJ met the 6 a.m. deadline Wednesday.\n\nBefore the August FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, Corcoran had claimed in June that Trump’s team had found no more classified material after a \"diligent\" search of the premises. Hundreds more documents were found at the estate after that statement, according to the Justice Department.\n\nSources say Corcoran had initially refused to speak with the federal grand jury about several crucial matters. Special Counsel Smith then asked Howell to decide whether the \"crime-fraud\" exception to attorney-client privilege could compel Corcoran’s further testimony. That testimony exception would apply to alleged conversations related to a possible plan to commit a crime.\n\n\"Prosecutors only attack lawyers when they have no case whatsoever,\" the Trump campaign said in a statement about the matter, arguing that an ABC News report claiming he \"misled his attorneys\" was \"disinformation.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"These leaks are happening because there is no factual or legal basis or substance to any case against President Trump,\" the campaign added. \"The deranged Democrats and their comrades in the mainstream media are corrupting the legal process and weaponizing the justice system in order to manipulate public opinion, because they are clearly losing the political battle.\"\n\nThe news surrounding the investigation into Trump's handling of the documents comes as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg weighs a potential indictment of the former president during his third run for the White House over alleged hush money payments.",

    "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nIt's not a regulatory issue. It's a bailout.\n\nWe've heard the spin from the White House and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that taxpayers won't have to pay for Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, but it is inevitable. When the FDIC assesses an extra fee of $25K to $1M for community banks to bailout SVB, local banks will do everything possible to tighten their belts and absorb the additional costs. Still, eventually, those fees will trickle down to its consumers. Sadly, hard-working Americans in small towns across America will pay more to recover money for a bank they've never heard of in Silicon Valley, CA.\n\nBut that is not the crux of this issue. The most dangerous part of this bailout is the message this administration is sending depositors, that your money is safer in big banks even when they fail. An overreaction to bad management at the SVB board and a panic by the White House must not take down community banks as collateral damage. Our local banks are the backbone of our communities and the primary funders for Main Street USA and rural America.\n\nThe costliest unintended consequence to our community banks is depositors leaving not only due to increased fees but because Secretary Yellen signaled that your deposits are safer in 'Too Big to Fail Banks.'\n\nTo encourage these deposits to stay in these community banks and level the playing field, Congress must debate the pros and cons of FDIC protections at a minimum for non-interest-bearing Demand Deposit Accounts. These business accounts are critical to community banks' viability, and the $250-$500K CDs deposits to small-town banks are crucial for lending to locally owned businesses and family farms. Their transfer to 'Too Big to Fail Banks' will only exacerbate the exit of smaller banks that cannot carry the regulatory burdens created by Dodd-Frank.\n\nFLASHBACK: TREASURY SEC. YELLEN DIDN'T BELIEVE SHE'D SEE ANOTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS IN HER LIFETIME\n\nWhat SVB did was a violation of Banking 101. Banks want to purchase long-term treasuries/bonds when interest rates are high and short-term treasuries/bonds when they are low. SVB did the opposite. As SVB watched interest rates rise, its bond portfolio value decreased. Couple that downswing with a large volume of deposits going out the door, which is not unusual for their VC-heavy customer base, and SVB quickly had a liquidity crisis- a cash flow issue.\n\nSoon after that, the run was underway.\n\nSVB ignored common sense measures. Interest rate risk assessment should be done quarterly by every bank, regardless of its size. Typically, a report on interest rate assessments prepared by an outside third-party expert is presented to the board every quarter - at a minimum. Interest rate risk testing assesses what would happen to the value of your bank if interest rates went up or down one to four percent. Presumably, this exercise was done at SVB and perhaps ignored by SVB's management team and board. Shockingly, the interest rate stress test is not included in the Federal Reserve's evaluation, which is a big mistake and, quite frankly, gross negligence on the Fed's part.\n\nOf course, there is more than just interest rate malfeasance. SVB gave gifts to surprising nonprofits, made green ESG investments, and had management selling off its stock just weeks before the collapse that contributed to this failure. The acceleration rate of the interest rate hikes only exacerbated their faulty financial plan.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLet me be clear; this was not a capital issue. The worst thing Congress could do now is throw more regulations at banks. Don't take the bait. Even if SVB had met the capital threshold, repealing S.2155 would not have prevented this reckless bank meltdown. Regulations will not save an irresponsible management team with an incompetent board from running amok.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn my personal experience, having served as a community bank board representative for 15 years overseeing the implementation of Dodd-Frank, I saw firsthand how the government's heavy hand drives up costs for local banks.\n\nGovernment overreach takes bank officers away from customer service and slows down their ability to do the business that nimble small-town banks were once known for. This bailout sends the wrong message. It's crony capitalism. I am standing with our community banks, the backbone of small businesses, that should not be negatively impacted by big government fixes for irresponsible management.",

    "text": "A recently formed super PAC that would likely serve as the main outside political group supporting Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' potential run for president is bringing on board a veteran GOP strategist who’s served as the top campaign consultant for Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nJeff Roe, who heads up the formidable Axiom Strategies, is joining the Never Back Down PAC as a senior adviser, multiple Republican sources with knowledge of the move confirmed to Fox News.\n\nThe super PAC is being chaired by Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and the 2013 GOP gubernatorial nominee who later served as acting deputy homeland security director during the last two years of the Trump administration. After coming on board the super PAC, Cuccinelli quickly held meetings with prominent conservative leaders in early voting states in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.\n\nCuccinelli, in an exclusive interview last week with Fox News Digital in New Hampshire, emphasized that he’s \"trying to provide an organizational center with the super PAC so that people can start getting ready if he [DeSantis] does decide to get in, which looks likely… that we’ll already have prepared the ground for him and he’ll be off and running to a much faster start than he otherwise could have pulled off.\"\n\nFIRST ON FOX: FORMER TOP TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL REVEALS MISSION OF NEW PRO-DESANTIS SUPER PAC\n\nDeSantis remains on the 2024 sidelines, but is widely expected to enter the race. In an interview that will run Thursday on Fox Nation, the Florida governor said \"stay tuned\" when asked about his political future.\n\nRoe’s addition to the Never Back Down PAC gives the organization another campaign trail veteran, joining executive director Chris Jankowski, another longtime Republican operative. According to GOP sources, the super PAC will be headquartered in Atlanta.\n\nTRUMP WIDENS LEAD OVER DESANTIS IN LATEST 2024 GOP PRIMARY POLL\n\nThe news regarding Roe, which was first reported by Politico, raises further doubts about Youngkin’s national ambitions. Roe and Axiom Strategies were instrumental behind the scenes in Youngkin’s 2021 victory in Virginia’s gubernatorial election, which helped make the first-time candidate from the business wing of the GOP an instant Republican superstar. Pundits have viewed Youngkin as a potential contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nRoe, in an appearance in February on Fox News’ \"Fox News Sunday,\" said he viewed the GOP presidential nomination race as a two-person battle between Trump and DeSantis, but later said those comments were not a reflection of a potential Younking campaign. He’s also indicated that his firm would likely work for only one presidential candidate in the 2024 cycle.\n\nA source in Youngkin’s political orbit told Fox News that Roe’s decision to join the pro-DeSantis super PAC is \"not really\" a sign that Youngkin is out of the 2024 mix.\n\nWHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE\n\nRoe was the top consultant on Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign, when the conservative firebrand from Texas fiercely battled Trump for the GOP nomination, ending up as runner-up to the former president. While Cruz initially flirted with another White House run in 2024, he’s made it clear in recent months that he’s running for re-election in the Senate next year.\n\nSuper PACs, known as independent expenditure-only committees, are legally allowed to raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, and to spend unlimited sums to support or oppose political candidates. Unlike traditional PACs, they are prohibited under long-standing federal rules from either coordinating or contributing directly to a candidate or candidate's campaign.\n\nTwo existing super PACs – \"Ready for Ron\" and \"Ron to the Rescue,\" which are not affiliated with DeSantis or his political circle – are already up and running, raising money as they urge the governor to launch a presidential campaign. But sources in DeSantis' wider political orbit have described those groups as \"a grift – plain and simple.\"\n\nTwo sources familiar with DeSantis’ political world told Fox News this month that Never Back Down PAC would likely have the governor’s blessing should he go forward and run for the White House.\n\nDeSantis saw his popularity soar among conservatives across the country over the past three years due to his forceful pushback against coronavirus pandemic restrictions and his aggressive actions as a culture warrior going after the media, corporations and teachers' unions.\n\nThe governor scored an overwhelming 19-point gubernatorial re-election victory in November, and in recent speeches he has pitched policy victories in Florida as a roadmap for the entire nation. He’s been traveling across the country, highlighting his \"Florida blueprint\" and promoting his newly released memoir, \"The Courage to Be Free.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSources in DeSantis’ wider orbit have said any presidential campaign launch would come in the late spring or early summer, after the end of the current legislative session.

    "authors": [],
    "summary": "In 2021, Burgum vetoed a bill that would have restricted transgender students from participating in public elementary and secondary school sports.\nIn North Dakota, similar bills to restrict transgender athletes have passed the House this session with veto-proof majorities.\nRight before the vote, Republican Rep. SuAnn Olson of Baldwin countered: \"Five years ago, this whole pronoun thing wasn’t a thing.\nIt puts teachers in the very difficult position\" of keeping up with students who switch their pronoun, she said.\nShe added that the bill would instill confidence in parents that their kids are safe at school and create learning environments without \"social distractions.\"",
    "text": "Public schools and state agencies in North Dakota would be prohibited from referring to students and employees by any pronouns that don't reflect the sex assigned to them at birth, under a bill approved by the legislature.\n\nThe House approved the bill 60-32 on Wednesday. It passed the Senate last month and now awaits the signature of Republican Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nIn 2021, Burgum vetoed a bill that would have restricted transgender students from participating in public elementary and secondary school sports. But Burgum has not said publicly if he supports this latest measure.\n\nThe bill is among hundreds nationwide that are taking aim at nearly every facet of transgender existence, from pronouns to bathroom use to health care to athletics. In North Dakota, similar bills to restrict transgender athletes have passed the House this session with veto-proof majorities. The Senate has not yet voted on them. Last week, Wyoming became the 19th state to ban transgender athletes from playing on girls or women’s sports teams.\n\nNORTH DAKOTA CONSIDERING BAN ON SEXUAL, LGBT-CENTRIC LIBRARY BOOKS\n\n\"It’s another week of a legislative session, and we have another bill that’s telling certain people that they have value or don’t have value in our state,\" Democratic Rep. Josh Boschee of Fargo said as he urged lawmakers to vote against the pronoun bill.\n\nRight before the vote, Republican Rep. SuAnn Olson of Baldwin countered: \"Five years ago, this whole pronoun thing wasn’t a thing. It puts teachers in the very difficult position\" of keeping up with students who switch their pronoun, she said. \"It’s just a common-sense bill that deserves a green vote.\"\n\nThe bill would not criminalize teachers or state employees. And if a teacher received approval from a student’s parent or guardian — and from the school administrator — the teacher would be allowed to use the pronouns a student prefers.\n\nSD REPUBLICANS PUSH FOR TRANS PROCEDURE BAN ON YOUTH\n\nAlthough the measure also affects state employees outside the schools, Wednesday's debate focused mostly on educational staff who would be affected. Supporters said the bill would ease burdens on teachers and create better learning environments for students\n\nThe bill would allow teachers to \"rest with relief that they only need to remember one name and (one) set of historically recognized biological pronouns,\" Republican Rep. Lori VanWinkle, of Minot, said in support. She added that the bill would instill confidence in parents that their kids are safe at school and create learning environments without \"social distractions.\"\n\nOpponents including Democratic Rep. Mary Schneider of Fargo cited the testimony of countless people who argued the bill would harm LGBTQ youth: mental health therapists, school counselors, social workers, suicide prevention advocates, church leaders and more.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchneider noted that these experts said the bill would not protect kids or promote learning, because \"the real threats to children are poverty, hunger, lack of health care, gun violence, bigotry, social pressures, mental health and bills like these.\"\n\nDemocrats and Republicans voted against the bill.\n\nA survey by The Trevor Project in 2022 found that 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the previous year, but that those who were supported socially or at school reported lower rates.",
